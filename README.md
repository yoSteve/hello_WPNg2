# Hello_WPNg2
Nothing fancy. Just looking for a way to connect an Angular2+ app to WordPress's new REST API (V2). I figured out how to use the REST API endpoints to access Custom Post Types, Custom Data Fields (generated with ACF), and Featured Image. Also created an Angular Pipe that transforms WP "The Content" calls into formatted HTML.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

`ng build --prod --deploy-url="/wordpress/wp-content/themes/wpNg2/dist/"`

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
